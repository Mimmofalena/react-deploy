### Simple react app with the following features to practice my skills :

-Build and deploy react

-Practice the use of useState Hook

-Input fields that shows an error if fields are not filled in

-Implemented a backdrop that shows when input fields are not filled in. The backdrop hides either on click of a button or clicking away

### Possible improvements

Persist data on refresh
